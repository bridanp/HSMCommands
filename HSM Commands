EXPIREBV
==========================================================================
EXPIREBV is used to delete all unneeded HSM dataset backups and ABARS.  There are a few additional parameters you can use
   besides "display" or "execute" as I do below, but for the most part if you are deleting these types of data, you probably rarely
   want to just do nonsms versions by themselves, ABARS alone, or start and end at a certain key.

HSEND EXPIREBV DISPLAY - Display the datasets to be expired before actually "doing the deed".
HSEND EXPIREBV EXECUTE - Actually remove the datasets.

Audit Command
==========================================================================
Audit is used to check for problems on the CDS (control dataset) and SDSP (small dataset packing datasets).
We haven't fully utilized SDSP in my shop ever actually, but the commands for auditing and fixing issues with SDSP are:

HSEND AUDIT MEDCTL(SDSP) VOLUMES(######) NOFIX ODS('some generic dataset')
HSEND AUDIT MEDCTL(SDSP) VOLUMES(######) FIX ODS('some generic dataset')

To audit and then fix CDS issues (BCDS, MCDS, or OCDS):
HSEND AUDIT BCDS NOFIX ODS('some generic dataset')
HSEND AUDIT BCDS NOFIX ODS('some generic dataset')
